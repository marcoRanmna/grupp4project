Present during stand-up meeting: Oscar, Alexander, Emma.
* Ideas for what we would like for our health-website-app idea
- Hide things on the website that isn't relevant to us (for example hide calories if it's not relevant to the specific user)
- Maybe use google fit API(REST) specifically for android and bluetooth devices
- Calender view on website
- Option to add things manually on website

* Until next time:
- Emma: research how useful google fit API might be for this project
- Oscar: Calender research
- Alexander: Calories and food research
- Marco: MongoDB Collections
